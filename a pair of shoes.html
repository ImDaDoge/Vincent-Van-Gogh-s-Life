							<h1>A Pair Of Shoes</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/shoes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This painting of a pair of down-at-heel shoes prompts speculation on a variety of psychological questions. They have been seen as symbolizing Van Gogh's difficult passage through life.
							A fellow student in Paris reported that Vincent bought these workman's boots at a flea market, intending to use them but they were too small so he used them as a painting refrence. However he wore them on a long and rainy walk to make them fit to be painted.
							Van Gogh made a number of still lives with old shoes. To him, as to several of his contemporaries, they may have been symbolic of the hard yet picturesque life of the laborer.
